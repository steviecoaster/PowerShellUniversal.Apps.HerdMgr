6. **Payment Terms**: NET 30 with automatic due date calculation

## 🔧 Configuration

### Database Path

Configured in module: `$script:DatabasePath = Join-Path $PSScriptRoot 'data\HerdManager.db'`

### PowerShell Universal Settings

Edit `.universal\dashboards.ps1`:

```powershell
$app = @{
    Name        = "Herd Manager"
    BaseUrl     = '/herdmanager'
    Module      = 'PowerShellUniversal.Apps.HerdManager'
    Command     = 'New-UDHerdManagerApp'
    AutoDeploy  = $true
    Environment = 'PowerShell 7'
}
```

## 🧪 Development

### Adding New Features

1. Create function in `functions\public\` or `functions\private\`
2. Export public functions in `.psd1` manifest
3. Add page in `dashboards\HerdManager\pages\`
4. Register page in `HerdManager.ps1` pages array
5. Add navigation menu item if needed

### Database Changes

1. Update `data\Database-Schema.sql`
2. Run ALTER TABLE commands on existing database
3. Update affected views and functions
4. Test data migration on sample data

Migrations included

- `src\PowerShellUniversal.Apps.HerdManager\data\Migrate-AddSystemInfo.ps1` - adds the `SystemInfo` table and seeds a default row
- `src\PowerShellUniversal.Apps.HerdManager\data\Migrate-AddSystemInfoEstablished.ps1` - adds the `Established` column to `SystemInfo` (if missing)

Note: After running migrations that change function parameters, restart PowerShell Universal so the runspace picks up the updated code (or copy the module into the installed modules directory and restart the service).

### Testing

- Test all CRUD operations after changes
- Verify date handling in forms and tables
- Check calculated fields (ADG, totals)
- Validate print layouts
- Ensure modal dialogs function correctly

Running unit tests

- Run all tests: `Invoke-Pester -Script tests -PassThru`
- Run the SystemInfo/Established tests only: `Invoke-Pester -Script tests\Set-SystemInfo.Established.Tests.ps1 -PassThru`

System Settings (UI and CLI)

- The app provides a System Settings page (Settings -> System Settings) to store farm-level metadata (Farm Name, Address, Default Currency/Culture, Notes, and Established).
- The "Established" field is intentionally simple: the UI accepts a 4-digit year (e.g. `2000`) and you may also provide a date string (e.g. `2000-01-01`) or pass a DateTime from the CLI.
   - If you provide a year it is stored as January 1st of that year (e.g. `2000` -> `2000-01-01`).
   - The form normalizes values and will accept array-wrapped values (as some UI controls return arrays).

CLI examples:

```powershell
# Set by year
Set-SystemInfo -Established 2000

# Set by date string
Set-SystemInfo -Established '2000-05-06'

# The function also accepts array-wrapped values (UI can send arrays)
Set-SystemInfo -Established @('2001')
```

Troubleshooting

- Error "Cannot convert the System.Object[] value ... to type System.DateTime" when saving Established: this can happen when a DatePicker-style control returns an array instead of a single value. The System Settings UI now uses a simple year textbox and the CLI `Set-SystemInfo` function unwraps arrays and normalizes the value.

### Deploying changes to a running PowerShell Universal

- After changing exported functions (for example, adding or removing parameters), you must copy the updated module files to the installed modules directory and restart the PowerShell Universal service so the running runspace picks up the new signatures.
- A helper script is provided at `src/tools/Sync-InstalledModule.ps1` to copy the module to the installed path and optionally restart the service:

```powershell
.\src\tools\Sync-InstalledModule.ps1 -RestartService
```

If you prefer not to restart the service, you can re-import the module in the target runspace (for development/testing) with:

```powershell
Import-Module -Force "C:\Path\To\PowerShellUniversal.Apps.HerdManager.psd1"
```

## 📝 Notes

### Date Format Considerations

- SQLite stores dates as TEXT
- Application uses MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ss format
- CAST AS TEXT in queries prevents PSSQLite auto-conversion errors
- Always use -As PSObject with Invoke-UniversalSQLiteQuery

### Performance Tips

- Indexes on CattleID, TagNumber, dates
- Views pre-calculate common joins
- Pagination on large tables (15-20 items per page)
- Dynamic loading with New-UDDynamic for data refresh

### Common Issues

- **Dates not displaying**: Add CAST AS TEXT to SQL query
- **Location not showing**: Check view includes Location column
- **Form not saving**: Verify SqlParameters match @Param names in query
- **Modal not opening**: Check Show-UDModal syntax and element IDs
